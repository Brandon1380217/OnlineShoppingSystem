# ShopEase - Online Shopping System

A full-stack member-based online shopping system, featuring both customer and business account functionality.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite + TailwindCSS + Recharts
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + SQLite (via better-sqlite3)
- **Auth**: JWT-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have these installed:

| Tool    | Version       | Check with            | Get it from                               |
|---------|---------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Node.js | **18 or newer** | `node -v`           | https://nodejs.org (pick the LTS installer) |
| npm     | 9 or newer    | `npm -v`              | Comes bundled with Node.js                |
| Git     | any recent    | `git --version`       | https://git-scm.com/downloads             |

> **Windows note:** `better-sqlite3` is a native module. If you hit a `node-gyp` / build error during `npm install`, install the **"Desktop development with C++"** workload from Visual Studio Build Tools: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/. Most users on Node 18+ LTS won't need this because a prebuilt binary is downloaded automatically.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Brandon1380217/OnlineShoppingSystem.git
cd OnlineShoppingSystem
```

### 2. Install dependencies (backend + frontend)

There are two separate `package.json` files — one in `backend/`, one in `frontend/`. Install both:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cd ../frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

You should now have `backend/node_modules/` and `frontend/node_modules/` folders. Expect this step to take 1-3 minutes.

### 3. Seed the database

This creates `backend/shopease.db` (a local SQLite file) and fills it with demo users, products, orders, reviews, and chat history.

```bash
cd backend
npm run seed
```

You should see `Database seeded successfully!`. Run this command again any time you want a **clean reset** — it wipes all tables and repopulates them.

### 4. Start both servers

The app needs **two terminals running at the same time** — one for the API, one for the web UI.

**Terminal 1 — Backend API (port 3001)**

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

Wait for `ShopEase API running on http://localhost:3001`. Leave this terminal open.

**Terminal 2 — Frontend dev server (port 5173)**

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Wait for `Local: http://localhost:5173/`. Leave this terminal open too.

### 5. Open the app

Visit **http://localhost:5173** in your browser and log in with any of the [demo accounts below](#demo-accounts).

To stop the servers later, press **Ctrl + C** in each terminal.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| `EADDRINUSE` on port 3001 or 5173 | Another process is using the port. Close it, or change it — backend uses `process.env.PORT` (`PORT=3002 npm run dev`); for frontend edit the `server.port` in `frontend/vite.config.js`. |
| Frontend shows a blank page / 401 errors | Make sure the backend is running on port 3001. The frontend proxies `/api` and `/uploads` to that port (see `frontend/vite.config.js`). |
| "Invalid email or password" | The DB may be empty. Re-run `cd backend && npm run seed`. |
| Weird DB errors after schema changes | Delete `backend/shopease.db`, `backend/shopease.db-shm`, `backend/shopease.db-wal`, then run `npm run seed` again. |
| Uploaded product images disappear after reset | Expected — uploaded files live in `backend/uploads/` and are gitignored. They are per-machine and survive server restarts but are removed when you manually clean that folder. |
| `node-gyp` / MSBuild errors on `npm install` (Windows) | See the Visual Studio Build Tools note in Prerequisites. |
| `ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED` / `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` mismatch from `better-sqlite3` when running the backend | Your Node.js version changed after `npm install` (or two Node installations are on your machine — e.g. a system Node plus one bundled with an IDE). Rebuild the native binary against the Node you actually run the backend with: open the terminal you use to run `npm run dev`, verify `node -v` matches, then `cd backend && npm rebuild better-sqlite3`. |
